# Feature Specification: Explicit workflow and view state

**Feature Branch**: No branch created; authored on `main`.
**Created**: 2026-10-18
**Status**: Draft for review
**Input**: Incrementally improve XState workflow and view ownership, using account-data-merge as a reference. Reduce scattered visual conditions and expose business decisions in statecharts instead of hiding workflows in functions.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Safely archive accounts (Priority: P1)

Users see account archive actions appropriate to their current access and receive clear progress and results.

**Why this priority**: A bounded first slice establishes a pattern for readiness, permission, persistence, and feedback.

**Independent Test**: Review and, after implementation approval, verify archiving independently of other forms.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** account/access observations are loading, **When** the page renders, **Then** it shows loading rather than treating missing facts as denial or empty data.
2. **Given** a ready workspace, **When** access is evaluated, **Then** only eligible accounts offer archive, and a direct action request cannot bypass the same policy.
3. **Given** an accepted archive request, **When** it settles, **Then** feedback identifies the affected account and accurate success/failure; repeated submission while busy starts no second operation.
4. **Given** an active request, **When** identity, workspace, binding, record availability, or permission changes, **Then** no further unauthorized work starts and issued writes are reconciled without claiming they were undone.

### User Story 2 - Understand blocked editing (Priority: P2)

Users can distinguish loading, missing workspace, read-only access, missing prerequisites, and editable forms across account creation, category/tag management, workspace/profile editing, and transaction entry.

**Why this priority**: Disabled controls and absent forms alone do not explain how to proceed.

**Independent Test**: Deliver and verify each editing surface separately, preserving existing validation and finance rules.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** transaction entry, **When** observations arrive, **Then** the view distinguishes no workspace, no usable account, no applicable category, read-only access, and readiness with appropriate explanations or existing recovery actions.
2. **Given** an editable form, **When** permission is lost, **Then** displayed capabilities and acceptance of new submissions change together.
3. **Given** invalid input, denied access, changed scope, or persistence failure, **When** the request ends, **Then** feedback distinguishes the applicable outcome instead of treating every outcome as a generic save error.

### User Story 3 - Use consistent form behavior (Priority: P2)

Users receive consistent submission, validation, progress, reset, and outcome behavior across forms, including when access or scope changes while a form is open.

**Why this priority**: Shared form behavior must support the domain workflows instead of leaving policy and lifecycle decisions in page callbacks.

**Independent Test**: Verify the shared form contract with one representative integration before adopting it in other forms one review cycle at a time.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a blocked or busy form, **When** submission is requested through either the UI or its workflow event interface, **Then** both paths follow the same capability policy and start no disallowed operation.
2. **Given** a submitted form, **When** validation, authorization, or persistence determines its result, **Then** the view receives the corresponding typed feedback and available actions without reconstructing them from raw errors or several independent flags.
3. **Given** an in-progress form, **When** reset, reopen, dialog close, scope replacement, or teardown occurs, **Then** the reviewed lifecycle policy determines whether work continues or cancels, preserves accurate issued-write outcomes, and isolates stale results.
4. **Given** two forms with different business rules, **When** they share form mechanics, **Then** each still applies its own domain authorization and preparation before persistence.

### User Story 4 - See coherent bank views (Priority: P3)

Users see bank setup and operation views with appropriate actions while previous sync results remain independently understandable.

**Independent Test**: Verify setup, discovery, mapping, manual sync, cancellation, and restricted views without changing provider behavior.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a setup/operation step, **When** the view updates, **Then** messages and actions correspond to that step without contradictory modes.
2. **Given** previous sync results, **When** another operation starts or fails, **Then** historical results remain distinct from the current operation.
3. **Given** reload, reconnection, or ordinary observation updates, **When** the view changes, **Then** no transaction fetch begins without existing explicit user action and verification.

### User Story 5 - Reveal and clear recovery data (Priority: P3)

Users reveal, confirm saving, and hide their recovery phrase with feedback tied to their current identity.

**Independent Test**: Verify this lifecycle independently of account connection or data merge.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a hidden phrase, **When** reveal succeeds or fails, **Then** one corresponding view appears and confirmation applies only to that revealed phrase.
2. **Given** a revealed phrase, **When** it is hidden, identity changes, or the owner unmounts, **Then** transient phrase/confirmation data is cleared and late results cannot reveal the old phrase.

### Edge Cases

- Missing observations versus empty results; subscription failures and retries.
- Permission/scope changes during validation, immediately before persistence, and after a write is issued.
- Duplicate events, stale child results, replaced bindings, and unexpected child failures.
- Navigation, cancellation, shutdown, and non-abortable writes during teardown.
- Accounts/categories becoming unavailable while a form remains open.
- Locale changes while feedback is visible; browser online status differing from actual remote confirmation.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Each delivered surface MUST expose relevant readiness, access, operation, and outcome states, with an explanation when users cannot proceed.
- **FR-002**: Displayed action availability and acceptance of requests MUST follow the same current capability policy. Authoritative write-time protections MUST remain.
- **FR-003**: Requests MUST remain bound to their intended identity, workspace, record, and dependencies where applicable. Scope changes MUST prevent new work under stale assumptions.
- **FR-004**: Workflows MUST distinguish applicable success, denial, invalid input, scope change, cancellation, partial completion, and failure. Partial completion applies only where actual partial work is possible.
- **FR-005**: Cancellation/shutdown MUST stop scheduling new work, settle or reconcile issued effects according to actual guarantees, and release resources before completion. Late events MUST NOT override shutdown/cancellation or affect replacement operations.
- **FR-006**: Presentation MUST receive explicit view choices and actions rather than reconstructing business readiness, authorization, or result classification from unrelated facts.
- **FR-007**: Existing finance semantics, local-first behavior, accessibility, localization, and provider consent/credential rules MUST remain. Current operation and historical results MUST stay distinct.
- **FR-008**: Recovery phrases MUST remain transient and identity-bound and be cleared on hide, identity replacement, and owner teardown.
- **FR-009**: Each slice MUST document its model/file scope before effects, present implementation for review, and add/run relevant automated coverage only after approval of that implementation.
- **FR-010**: Shared form behavior MUST own submission acceptance, validation/progress feedback, and applicable reset/reopen/cancellation semantics. An external disabled flag MUST NOT be the sole protection against disallowed events.
- **FR-011**: Each form's domain workflow MUST own authorization, preparation, scope-change decisions, and persistence outcomes. Shared form mechanics MUST support composition without embedding every entity's business rules or hiding those rules in a generic save callback.
- **FR-012**: Shared form presentation MUST receive typed feedback and capabilities; consumers MUST NOT repeatedly interpret raw errors or combine lifecycle flags to decide which actions or result view apply.

### Key Entities

- **Observed scope**: Identity, workspace, dependency binding, loaded records, and access facts.
- **Capability**: Whether an action is currently allowed and the reason when unavailable.
- **Request/result**: Intended operation target and classified outcome, separate from historical results.
- **Review cycle**: Focused model/implementation review followed by approved verification.

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Every delivered surface has acceptance coverage for every applicable blocked reason and terminal outcome, with a visible explanation for blocked reasons.
- **SC-002**: Every approved permission/scope-change scenario starts no new unauthorized operation and attributes no result to replacement scope.
- **SC-003**: Duplicate-submission scenarios have at most one active operation; interruption scenarios never report unconfirmed persistence as completed or committed writes as undone.
- **SC-004**: Existing actions remain available to eligible users and relevant approved regression checks pass before a slice is marked verified.
- **SC-005**: Every slice records model review, implementation review, and verification separately; documentation/type checking alone never establishes completion.

## Assumptions

- Behavior-preserving architecture refactor with clearer blocked/error feedback; no visual redesign or access-policy changes.
- The merge branch is a reference, not a dependency to merge wholesale. Its unfinished importer/coordinator is outside scope.
- Account archiving is first. This spec does not authorize a site-wide implementation batch.
- No new persisted domain schema, provider operation, or unsupported connectivity observer is assumed.
- Simple input/disclosure state, optional display fields, formatting, and pure transformations may remain outside workflow models.
- Technical direction and progress tracking are in [delivery.md](delivery.md). Detailed implementation tasks follow reviewed design.
