# Tasks: Link Internal Transfers

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/010-transfer-linking/`

**Prerequisites**: `plan.md`, `spec.md`, `research.md`, `data-model.md`, and `quickstart.md`

**Tests**: No test tasks are included before the implementation has been shown to and approved by the user. At each review, identify affected unit and Playwright coverage. Update and run only the relevant tests after that approval.

**Organization**: Tasks follow the three user stories; shared schema and authorization are foundational.

## Phase 1: Setup

**Purpose**: Existing project and tooling are already established.

No setup tasks.

---

## Phase 2: Foundational Relationship and Authorization

**Purpose**: Establish the persisted pair, enforce Jazz security and every safety invariant currently supported by its policy engine, and identify app-owned validation/recovery for capability gaps.

- [ ] T001 Add the workspace-scoped `internalTransfers` table and policy-checkable endpoint account, amount, and currency facts in `src/lib/schema/transactions.ts`, the optional `canDelete` capability in `src/lib/schema/accounts.ts`, expose the transfer row type in `src/lib/schema.ts`, and add the workspace reverse relation in `src/lib/schema/identity.ts`.
- [ ] T002 Add additive Jazz migrations and matching schema snapshots under `src/lib/migrations/` from the current schema heads, defaulting existing account grants to no delete authority and policy facts to null; do not reset local or remote data.

**Review checkpoint**: Review the pair data model and additive migration before changing authorization or UI.

### Authorization slice

- [ ] T003 Add account permission calculations in `src/lib/domain/organization-permissions.ts` so delete authority is checked independently and existing write grants do not imply delete.
- [ ] T004 Keep read/insert/update/delete authorization and positive Jazz safety checks for endpoint facts/markers, both-account write access, both-account read access for relationship details, and per-endpoint delete authorization in `src/lib/permissions.ts`. Add a positive `.whereNew` marker-transition guard so a linked transaction marker may be preserved or cleared, and a new marker may be set only when the old marker was null. Verify the guard using the deployed policy fixture. Do not add a null-marker relationship delete rule to the current atomic unlink: alpha.59 rejects it because its endpoint lookups observe pre-update values. Retain app validation/recovery for gaps; do not publish negative correlated existence checks in alpha.59 because the authority rejects them.
- [ ] T005 Add administrator-facing management for workspace members' account delete grants, independent of read/write access, in `src/routes/accounts/+page.svelte` and `src/lib/components/AccountList.svelte`, with localized labels in `messages/en.json` and current account archive behavior preserved.

**Review checkpoint**: Jazz policies enforce who may read or mutate transfer data and the proven endpoint/marker-transition safety rules; app safety logic covers preflight and any malformed/conflicting cases the current policy engine cannot prevent. Administrators can assign delete authority independently of write authority.

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Find and Link a Matching Movement (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Suggest eligible existing opposite-direction transactions and atomically link the user's selection.

**Independent Test**: Two equal, opposite-direction transactions in different accounts of one workspace appear as a suggestion within seven days; confirming preserves both rows and creates no duplicate movement.

### Implementation

- [ ] T006 [P] [US1] Implement pure counterpart eligibility and deterministic ordering in `src/lib/domain/internal-transfer.ts`: opposite kind, different account, same workspace, exact amount and currency, seven-day inclusive date range, and unlinked endpoints.
- [ ] T007 [US1] Implement a machine-first link workflow in `src/lib/machines/internal-transfer.ts` using a mergeable Jazz transaction to read both current local endpoints, recheck permissions and compatibility, stage the relationship atomically, await local durability only, and report local success, cancellation, denial, or failure. Do not claim cross-device offline uniqueness.
- [ ] T008 [US1] Add the transaction-edit parent machine in `src/lib/machines/transaction-edit.ts` to own the whole form workflow, invoke the scoped form and transfer operation children, publish a discriminated UI view, and accept typed intent events; keep Jazz subscriptions, dependency binding, observation adaptation, and parent actor lifecycle wiring in `src/lib/components/TransactionEditEntry.svelte`. Do not duplicate child lifecycle as parent context flags or have presentation inspect child-private state.
- [ ] T009 [US1] Add the props-only suggestion list in `src/lib/components/InternalTransferSuggestions.svelte` and connect its selection and confirmation callbacks through `src/lib/components/TransactionForm.svelte`.
- [ ] T010 [P] [US1] Add localized transfer suggestion, empty state, confirmation, and result messages in `messages/en.json` and compile Paraglide after implementation review.

**Checkpoint**: A user can link an eligible imported or manual transaction without creating or mutating either movement.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Record Both Sides Together (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Let a user create a manual expense and income and their relationship with one submission and one user-visible completion.

**Independent Test**: Submit a paired transfer between two writable accounts while offline. Verify exactly two account entries and one relationship commit locally together; later Jazz permission rejection is shown as a separate sync outcome.

### Implementation

- [ ] T011 [US2] Implement an `internal-transfer-create` statechart that owns account reads, workspace/currency/permission/safety decisions, transaction and relationship staging in one mergeable transaction, local durability, rollback, cancellation, and typed outcomes. Promise actors perform leaf reads/writes only.
- [ ] T012 [US2] Add a focused paired-transfer integration component and `/transfers/new` route that own Jazz observations and actor lifecycle, and collect source account, destination account, amount, and shared date for one submission.
- [ ] T013 [US2] Add a props-only paired-transfer form using existing transaction form conventions, with clear source/destination account inputs and one completion/error result.
- [ ] T014 [US2] Add localized paired-creation labels, validation, pending, success, and failure messages in `messages/en.json` and compile Paraglide after implementation review.

**Checkpoint**: A user can record a transfer between manually maintained accounts with one submission, and both sides are locally durable together. Later permission rejection remains a separately reported sync outcome.

### Offline safety and sync outcomes

- [x] T014a Serialize safety-sensitive transfer mutations within the active local workspace through an explicit domain owner; document that this does not serialize writes across independently offline devices.
- [ ] T014b Implement app conflict detection for two independent clients linking one endpoint while offline; an alpha.59 probe showed both conflicting marker writes can be accepted after reconnect. Expose a deterministic effective-link view that prevents double counting, and provide a repair flow that still passes Jazz permissions. Keep this as recovery without weakening positive Jazz-enforced safety.
- [x] T014c Verify tracked link and unlink transaction IDs correlate late rejections to operation-specific rollback notices; retain generic reporting for unmatched, evicted, or post-restart rejections. Review and test this behavior before completion.

### T014c verification notes

- The application-readiness machine owns Jazz's mutation-rejection observer for the active session. Operation write IDs are tracked before local settlement; matching late rejection notices retain the operation and transfer ID. The tracking list is bounded to 64 entries, and unmatched IDs use a generic notice.
- Focused application-readiness tests verify tracked link correlation, both unlink/delete write correlations, unmatched IDs, eviction at the 64-entry bound, and generic fallback after a fresh actor starts without prior in-memory tracking.
- Verification: `pnpm exec vitest run src/lib/machines/application-readiness.test.ts` passed (46 tests); `git diff --check` passed.

**Review checkpoint**: Local durability, later server rejection, and cross-device safety conflicts are separate outcomes with separate owners.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - See Correct Totals for Linked Movements (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Keep linked movements in account histories while excluding them from workspace expense and category totals.

**Independent Test**: A linked expense appears in the source account's transactions but is excluded from the overview total and category breakdown; unlinking restores its contribution.

### Implementation

- [x] T015 [US3] Observe readable internal-transfer rows for the active workspace and selected accounts in `src/routes/+page.svelte`, preserving current account filters and loading/error feedback.
- [x] T016 [US3] Filter linked expense IDs from period totals, category slices, and visible expense rows in `src/lib/components/ExpenseOverview.svelte`; leave `src/lib/components/TransactionView.svelte` and account balance/history semantics intact.

**Checkpoint**: Workspace totals exclude linked movements and account transaction history still includes both sides.

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Safely Manage a Transfer Link (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Preserve pairing invariants during edits, provide explicit unlink, and require correct per-account authority for linked deletion.

**Independent Test**: Non-pairing edits preserve the link; invalidating amount/account edits cannot persist while linked; unlink preserves both transactions; deletion follows one of the two approved choices and permission outcomes.

### Implementation

- [x] T017 [US4] Design reciprocal unlink enforcement against alpha.59: stage marker clearing before relationship deletion on one offline replica; handle deletion arriving first from another replica (rejected without retry); make the pending-unlink relationship readable through a positive both-linked-or-both-clear predicate while retaining read access checks on both endpoint accounts; and model local durability, partial sync, cancellation, and shutdown before implementation.
- [x] T018 [US4] Observe the selected transaction's readable internal-transfer relationship in `src/lib/components/TransactionEditEntry.svelte` and expose explicit link status and unlink callbacks through `src/lib/components/TransactionForm.svelte`.
- [x] T019 [US4] Protect linked amount/account edits in `src/lib/machines/transaction-save.ts`; preserve compatible metadata edits and require explicit unlink before a one-sided change can invalidate the pair.
- [x] T020 [US4] Add machine-owned mergeable delete-both and unlink-and-delete operations with separate endpoint Jazz delete checks, local durability, and typed outcomes in `src/lib/machines/internal-transfer.ts`.
- [x] T021 [US4] Add the linked-transaction deletion choices and reporting-effect explanation to `src/lib/components/TransactionDetails.svelte` and `src/lib/components/TransactionEditEntry.svelte`.
- [x] T022 [US4] Add localized link-status, unlink, delete-choice, permission-denied, delete-grant, and totals-effect messages in `messages/en.json` and compile the catalog after implementation review.

**Checkpoint**: Link lifecycle operations cannot leave an invalid pair, reveal an inaccessible counterpart, or delete an endpoint without its own delete authority.

---

## Phase 6: Review and Cross-Cutting Work

**Purpose**: Prepare the implementation for the user's review and then complete approved verification.

- [x] T023 Inspect the complete new actor tree and helpers for hidden orchestration, cancellation/cleanup gaps, stale observations, and permission rechecks; record findings in `specs/010-transfer-linking/tasks.md`.
- [x] T024 Identify the affected existing unit and Playwright test files and fixtures in `specs/010-transfer-linking/tasks.md` for the implementation review; keep test-file changes and execution outside this task list.

### T020 implementation review notes

- The application-owned transfer mutation coordinator routes and serializes delete requests with create, link, and unlink operations for the active workspace. The delete child checks the relationship, endpoint facts, reciprocal/pending markers, edit access to both accounts, the requested choice, and delete access separately for each endpoint before writing.
- A linked pair clears both endpoint markers in one local transaction and waits for local durability before deleting. The second local transaction deletes the relationship and the selected endpoint(s) together. A previously cleared pair can retry deletion. Cancellation or shutdown before writes returns without mutation; after marker clearing it returns `recoveryRequired`; once record deletion starts the actor drains that write and reports its settlement.
- The machine models two committed local phases because alpha.59 rejects deleting the relationship while endpoint markers still refer to it. Machine tests cover both local phases. In the full app `createPolicyTestApp` fixture, an owner-authorized relationship delete after marker clearing and a relationship-plus-endpoint delete bundle both remained unsettled at `tier: 'global'` through 8–12 second focused timeouts; no `AuthorizationDenied` result surfaced. This is inconclusive, not proof of denial, and blocks claiming authority-settlement verification for T020. The simplified transfer-policy fixture still verifies its smaller relationship-delete case, but does not substitute for the full app policy path.
- `src/lib/internal-transfer-delete-jazz.test.ts` verifies that the production app schema and policy persist the marker-clear and relationship-plus-endpoint delete bundle locally; the test does not claim global-tier settlement.
- Jazz remains the authority for endpoint delete and relationship delete permissions. The machine's preflight checks only improve local feedback; an authority rejection remains a separate synchronization outcome. Cross-device stale observations remain subject to Jazz policy enforcement and the already documented safety-conflict recovery work.
- The editor's operation owner needs the active workspace scope even when the selected workspace changes after its initial attachment. `WorkspaceBootstrap.svelte` now forwards workspace-scope observations to application readiness, which updates the serialized mutation owner; an application-readiness unit test covers scope set and clear.
- T021 presents both deletion choices in a separate props-and-callbacks component. The parent transaction-edit machine owns the selected deletion operation and result. The selected-only explanation states that the remaining movement becomes ordinary income or expense and counts toward totals. The route kind remains stable if the deleted row disappears before result feedback renders.

### T020–T022 review test inventory and verification

- `src/lib/machines/internal-transfer.test.ts`: covers both-endpoint and selected-endpoint choices, separate endpoint delete grants, linked versus pending markers, cancellation after marker clearing, local settlement failures, and write tracking for both stages.
- `src/lib/machines/internal-transfer-mutation-owner.test.ts`: covers delete dispatch, same-workspace serialization, queued cancellation, scope changes, shutdown, and late write outcomes.
- `src/lib/machines/transaction-edit.test.ts`: covers parent-machine dispatch for both choices, form lockout while deletion is pending, and publication of a denied result.
- `src/lib/machines/application-readiness.test.ts`: covers active workspace scope forwarding to the serialized mutation owner and clearing that scope.
- `src/lib/permissions.test.ts` and `src/lib/internal-transfer-delete-jazz.test.ts`: cover endpoint delete grants and local deletion durability with the production app schema and policy.
- `tests/transaction-edit.e2e.ts`: covers both deletion choices, local row/link deletion, the remaining expense's restored `$1.00` total, and existing link/unlink behavior.
- Verification: focused unit tests passed (69 tests); transaction-edit Playwright tests passed (16 tests); `pnpm check`, `pnpm check:tests`, and `git diff --check` passed. Global-tier delete acknowledgment remains unresolved as documented above.

## Dependencies and Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup**: No work required.
- **Foundational**: T001–T005 must finish before a relationship is queried or created. T002 follows T001. Review the data model/migration after T002. T004 follows T001 and T003; T005 follows T003 and T004. Review authorization/grant management after T005.
- **User Story 1**: Depends on the complete foundation. T006 precedes T007; T007 precedes the editor integration and presentation tasks.
- **User Story 2**: Depends on the foundation and T007; T011–T014 implement paired creation.
- **User Story 3**: Depends on T001 and T011/T014; reporting tasks T015–T016 can be reviewed independently once links exist.
- **User Story 4**: Depends on all foundation tasks and T007; T017 precedes unlink UI, and T020 precedes delete choices.
- **Review**: T023–T024 follow implementation. Test files and test execution are outside this task list.

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1**: Requires the foundational relationship table and policy.
- **US2**: Requires the relationship table and authority policy; paired creation is a separate route/actor from existing transaction linking.
- **US3**: Requires the relationship table; behavior can be reviewed independently after either US1 or US2 creates a relationship.
- **US4**: Requires US1 persistence and applies to relationships created through either linking or paired creation.

### Parallel Opportunities

- After T001, migration T002 is the first review checkpoint. Account-delete grant work T003 and transfer policy T004 are sequential after that review; grant UI T005 follows the policy.
- After T006, the pure matching helper and UI-copy review can proceed independently, but machine and editor integration remain sequential.
- Reporting work T011–T012 is independent of the link editor after the schema/policy foundation.
- No concurrent implementation is planned because the repository requires one focused review cycle at a time.

## Implementation Strategy

Deliver the relationship and policy first, then existing-transaction suggestions/linking, paired manual creation, reporting, and finally lifecycle/deletion. Each stage is a focused review checkpoint. Do not expose a persistent link or paired creation until account histories, totals, and privacy behavior are coherent. Keep all test edits and execution behind review of the production code they cover.
